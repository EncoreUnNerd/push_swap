Welcome to the repo of 42 project “push_swap”. 👋 

## Description of this project

The aim of this project is to teach us how to sort, and all the algorithms that go with it.

The project asks us to sort a list of numbers, using only a limited set of movements and 2 stacks.

The project was fun and allowed us to learn a lot of different things, but above all to get stronger and stronger in C.

DON'T CLONE THIS PROJECT. As always, I recommend that you do it yourself, otherwise there's no point. This repo is there to keep track of the past. But if you ever want another perspective on the project, it can also be useful.
